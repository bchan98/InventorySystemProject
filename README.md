This application manages inventory for the user. Parts and products can be added or removed from the system. A product is an object that can consist of multiple parts, while a part is just a simple object. This items can be added and have attributes freely modified. Additionally, parts and products can be searched for, with information being retrieved on the object.

To begin, start the program and add some basic parts with any specific stock for inventory. Then, products can be made from consisting part. The program handles basic logic checks, such as only positive inventory amounts. Additionally, parts that are required for products cannot be deleted from the system to prevent logic errors.
